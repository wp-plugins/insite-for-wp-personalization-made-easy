== Frequently Asked Questions ==

See full FAQs at: http://www.insite.io/faqs/

= How does inSite work? =
inSite allows you to dynamically personalize your website based on the conditions of when the visitor comes to your site, this means your site can automatically react to your visitors. It works on a system of triggers and changes. The trigger checks the conditions of when the visitor comes to the site and then triggers if it matches the rules you’ve set. You can see the list of available triggers below. The change is up to you: you can add a new element to your site, include some custom code (or shortcodes) or have a notification bar display on your site. You can see the available changes below. 

= Can I use the inSite plugin on my localhost wordpress installation =
Unfortunately not. The inSite plugin can only work on wordpress installations that have a public ip address and therefore wordpress running on localhost is not supported

When you publish an inSite, we are generating a javascript file that is being added to your site by the wordpress plugin. This javascript file is being served from a cdn and have minimal impact on your site performance. The javascript file checks if the condition of the insite is met and if so it is executing the inSite change (action).

= Do I need to register to inSite when activating an inSite? =
Yes, you will need to register register in order to activate your inSites.
inSite is a service provided by Duda. Registering will allow Duda to send you statistics emails about the performance of your inSites, will allow you to share inSites with the community and setup your profile.

= What are the triggers available to build an inSite? =
1.	Time - Define the time and date that you want the inSite  to appear, it can be a recurring event (daily, weekly, monthly) or one time thing. 
2.	Visitor - Trigger an inSite based on the number of times a visitor has come to your site. Can be the first time or any other time after.
3.	Location - Based on where the visitor is currently you can have an inSite trigger to display something different on your site.
4.	Device - Trigger an inSite based on the device type that the visitor is currently using.
5.	Campaign URL- Created a dedicated URL parameter that can be appended to your site and change the content of the page.
6.	Custom Trigger - Run some custom JavaScript code and cause an inSite to trigger based on the conditions that you want [Advanced].
Triggers can be mixed and matched to fit just the right conditions for your needs.


= What are the available changes I can add to my site? =
1.	New element - Add new content to one or more pages of your site. The element can contain buttons, text, images, custom HTML, or shortcodes from other plugins. If you want to dig in on your own, you can control all the HTML of the inSite element.
2.	Notification bar - A friendly message on top of your site that allows you to promote an event or promotion you have coming up. 
3.	Special effect - Add special effects such as falling hearts, fireworks or snowflakes to make your site more fun. 
4.	Custom JavaScript - The possibilities are literally endless. Execute your own JavaScript code when this inSite is triggered. 

= Can I use my existing wordpress plugins like contact forms and gallery with inSite? =
Yes you can insert any regular shortcode and embed it directly into the inSite during inSite creation. That shortcode will be added to your site when the inSite is triggered.

= Will inSite make my site load slower? =
No. When we add content to your site, we are doing it via JavaScript after the page loads. This means that all of your primary content will be loaded first and inSite will be triggered shortly after the page actually loads.
